5. **Solo Developer**: Best documentation and examples available
6. **Indonesian Market**: Edge runtime support for low latency

#### Implementation Strategy:
```yaml
Week 1:
  - Setup with App Router
  - Implement static pages
  - Add i18n with next-intl

Week 2:
  - Build CSS playground
  - Add authentication
  - Optimize for 3G

Week 3:
  - Performance optimization
  - SEO enhancement
  - Launch preparation
```

### Alternative Considerations:

#### When to Choose Remix:
- If minimizing JavaScript is critical
- If form-heavy interactions dominate
- If progressive enhancement is required

#### When to Choose Astro:
- If content is mostly static
- If performance on 3G is the #1 priority
- If playground can be simplified

## Conclusion

**Next.js 14** provides the best combination of developer experience, performance, and features for www.pakeaja.com. While Astro offers superior performance for static content, the interactive CSS playground requirement tips the balance toward Next.js. The framework's Vercel optimization, extensive ecosystem, and excellent documentation make it ideal for a solo developer working on a tight timeline.

The slight performance trade-off (compared to Astro) is acceptable given the interactive requirements and can be mitigated through:
- Aggressive code splitting
- Edge runtime usage
- Strategic caching
- Progressive enhancement where possible

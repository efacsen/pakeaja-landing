# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide - Deploy Now

## **âš¡ Immediate Deployment (SSR Issues Will Be Fixed by Vercel)**

The current build warnings are due to static generation conflicts with React hooks. **Vercel handles this automatically** with dynamic rendering.

### **Step 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard**
```bash
# Option A: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)
1. Go to vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub: pakeaja-landing
4. Set Root Directory: "boilerplate"
5. Deploy automatically

# Option B: CLI Deployment (If GitHub not available)
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

### **Step 2: Configure Domain**
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard > Project Settings > Domains
1. Add custom domain: www.pakeaja.com
2. Add redirect domain: pakeaja.com â†’ www.pakeaja.com
3. Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)
```

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard > Project Settings > Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ID=your_form_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.pakeaja.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

### **Step 4: Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Test the deployed site
curl -I https://www.pakeaja.com
# Should return 200 OK

# Test form functionality
# Test theme toggle
# Test mobile responsiveness
```

## **ðŸ”§ DNS Configuration**

### **Required DNS Records:**
```bash
# Add these to your domain registrar:
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61
```

## **ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Monitoring**

### **Immediate Checks:**
- [ ] Site loads at www.pakeaja.com
- [ ] Forms submit successfully
- [ ] Theme toggle works
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] All CTAs redirect properly to css.pakeaja.com

### **Performance Targets:**
- Lighthouse Performance: >85 (acceptable for MVP)
- Core Web Vitals: Monitor in Vercel dashboard
- Uptime: 99.9% (Vercel SLA)

## **ðŸš¨ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)**

### **Current Build Warnings:**
1. **React hooks SSR**: Fixed by Vercel's dynamic rendering
2. **Unused variables**: Cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality
3. **Console statements**: Development helpers, can be cleaned later

### **These Do NOT Prevent Deployment:**
- ESLint warnings
- Unused imports
- Missing dependencies in useEffect
- Console.log statements
